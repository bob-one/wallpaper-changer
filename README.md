# wallpaper-changer

A simble bash script to cycle through my wallpaper folder at random, without repeating any wallpapers before every single one has been shown once.

You can run it once every startup, use cron to change every x minutes or bind it to a hotkey.

This script was made because:

+ Every random wallpaper setter I've come across repearts wallpapers before every single wallpaper has been shown
+ reduce wallpaper fatigue
+ Just because

And please read the script before use, it's a good habit to acquire.
